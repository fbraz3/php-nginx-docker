# Braz PHP-Nginx Docker

This project provides optimized Docker images to run PHP applications with the Nginx web server. 

It is based on [php-fpm-docker](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-fpm-docker) and [php-base-docker](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-base-docker), supporting multiple PHP versions and architectures.

We also provide an AI generated [DeepWiki Page](https://deepwiki.com/fbraz3/php-nginx-docker) with more technical information.

ðŸ’¡ For a complete list of available images, please visit the [PHP System Docs](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-system-docs) page.

## Build Status

[![Build Base Images](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-nginx-docker/actions/workflows/base-images.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-nginx-docker/actions/workflows/base-images.yml) [![Build Phalcon Images](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-nginx-docker/actions/workflows/phalcon-images.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-nginx-docker/actions/workflows/phalcon-images.yml)

## Tags
Each image is tagged with the PHP version. For example:
- `fbraz3/php-nginx:8.4` for PHP 8.4
- `fbraz3/php-nginx:8.4-phalcon` for PHP 8.4 with Phalcon extension

Multi-architecture images (`amd64` and `arm64`) are also available.

## Flavors
This project supports different `flavors` to meet specific needs:

- `Vanilla`: Standard image with PHP and Nginx.
- `Phalcon`: Includes support for the Phalcon framework.

## How to Use
To run a PHP application with Nginx, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --name my-app -v $(pwd):/app/public -p 80:80 -d fbraz3/php-nginx:8.4
```

Replace `8.4` with the desired PHP version.

### Testing the Image
You can test the image with the following command:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1/
```

Ensure the current directory contains an `index.php` or `index.html` file.

## Manage PHP Directives via Environment Variables

## Cronjobs
To configure `cronjobs`, see the corresponding section in the [php-fpm-docker documentation](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-fpm-docker#cronjobs).
